# React-create-element

Overview

In this lab, you'll build a simple view using createElement().


Your task will be to create a React element that represents you (or a close approximation, hopefully)! In the src/index.js file create a variable called meInReact. This variable should be a React element, and should have the following structure:

<div class="me">
  <h1>An Awesome Person</h1>
  <p>Who is learning React</p>
  
  <ul class="my-interests">
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>React</li>
    <li>Movies</li>
    <li>Ice cream</li>
  </ul>
</div>

To start the application type this in the terminal:

npm install
npm start

To run the test suite type this in the terminal:

npm test

Feel free to render out the component in the DOM using ReactDOM.render().

NOTE!!
